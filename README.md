# ‚ö†Ô∏è New York City Health Code Violations ‚ö†Ô∏è
## Project Overview
This project is an exploration of patterns in restaurant health code violations across New York City. It aims to look at a few key aspects of these violations in tandem with reviews of these restaurants to see whether or not health code violations impact customer experiences. Using analysis of NYC restaurant health code violation and government data and natural language processing of restaurant review data, our team investigated the relationships between restaurant violations, customer experience, and geographical region over time.
### Our Motivating Questions
üåê Regional differences: How do health code violations differ from borough to borough? Which are the most common in each borough, and which borough has the most severe health code violations?

‚úçÔ∏è Restaurant reviews: How did restaurant reviews change for these restaurants from before and after their health code violations were issued? What topics were most prominent when it came to restaurant reviews, more specifically bad ones. 

‚≠ê Health code violations vs customer experience: Does receiving health code violations impact the customer experience with the restaurant?

üïê Time differences: How do health code violations change over time? How does it change regionally over time?

üìà Socioeconomic factors: How do health code violations correlate with socioeconomic factors, like income, of different regional areas?

## Technology & Methods
We visualize our project using Shiny which you can access here: https://humairaahmed02.shinyapps.io/Group_J_HealthCodeViolations/

Within this website you will find a series of static and interactive graphs and maps that help try to tackle some of our motivating questions above. The website may take a second to load some of the figures, especially in the 'violations page', but won't take any longer than ~30 seconds when toggling and loading the page.
