I didn't get a lot of chicken for the higher price charged. It was $15.00 for the larger container. The same size container everyone else charges $12.00 for. The lady serving the food did not speak English. I asked her how much she charged for it before she started making it. I said 3 times, but she kept making the plate. After she was done, she then went and got a co-worker who spoke English. I was upset, but since she made it already, I took the food. I order the same exact thing at other Spanish food restaurants, and I get 5 pieces of chicken. She only gave me 3 pieces. That's 5 pieces of chicken for $12.00 and 3 for $15.00. Hmm.
I couldn't eat it after a few bites due to the blandness of the food. It needed more seasoning. Even my mother commented on how she needed more salt, which was not on the tables. It was not the food experience I was looking for, and I would not be returning.",1729548812,FALSE,"MI CASA RESTAURANT"

A little far from the subway unless you're a local or have a car. The entrance to the parking lot is a little funky unless you enter from 2 directions (north and west).

I took a gamble and tried their brisket sandwich. It was about the same price as the burger I was going to order so why not? When it arrived I was skeptical. It was kinda grey and uniform in color. Visually it didn't look as appealing as a smoked brisket with darker singed edges from a BBQ joint. But more often then not smoked briskets come out dry and overcooked. One bite of this and I am hooked. This was perfectly moist and tender and a little fatty the way meat should be. The meat could be pulled apart but not rubbery.

My friend said the western omelets and the Irish breakfast. They cleaned their plates. Would recommend 100%",1741540908,FALSE,"BEL-AIRE DINER"

From the moment we walked in, we were hit with the warm, welcoming vibe that makes you feel right at home. The retro booths, bright signage, and cozy aesthetic give that perfect throwback feel like stepping into a movie scene.

The food? Absolutely fantastic. We tried a little bit of everything: disco fries, mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders with their signature sauce, and the Chupacabra Burger, which was a flavor bomb in the best way possible. Their Candy Shop Belgian Waffle was the sweetest ending to our meal, and the Broadway Smoothie was a hit for my little one!

But what really made this visit special was the staff. Our server, Adrian, deserves a huge shout-out! He was attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed. It's rare to find service that feels this personal and genuine.

Bonus points: Kids eat FREE! A huge perk for families!

Serving really delicious pizza and great customer service is what Lulu’s Pizza is all about. You even get a free can of soda or a free bottle of water when you order two slices of the plain pizza for a total of $5, a sweet deal that can’t be beat!!!
The place is super clean, the service is very efficient, the pizza comes out the oven crispy and super hot EVERY time!!! Even the tables outside are clean.
Although outside seating is limited, the tables for the most part are usually available as this is a busy shopping area (directly opposite Queens Center Mall) and people eat their pizza quickly and are on their way. I VERY HIGHLY recommend this place because the owner and the staff go out of their way to make the experience worthwhile (great food and great service). Although this is a relatively small place, you will keep coming back for more.
The guy Adan, who makes the pizza and then gives it to you with smile, is super friendly and I have ALWAYS seen him constantly working so hard and yet he goes out of his way to be nice.

After I finished my meal, the waitress told me that my bill came out to $11. When I ask them how come they told me $7 when I first came in, one of the people that was cooking told me the prices had changed. When I looked on the price list inside the store it’s at $8.99 for a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. Even with taxes, it would not be $11 in the state of New York. He told me that the prices have changed, but he still had the old price up. I feel this is deceptive advertising and I recommend that you stay clear of this place.

She spoke very little ... just took my order and disappeared for a good half hour. Ironically she was the one that told me the place closes at 7:30 when I walked in at 6:30. I thought — who cares, I have plenty of time. Little did I know my order wasn't going to come out for 30 minutes! It felt like I was sitting there forever.

The owner took the food out of the container and handed it back to the cook. I'm not even sure what it was. It was just so off putting, especially NOW after reading so many reviews about that kind of thing. I worried later, about whether I would have a stomach ache ""later"" and I did not.

The vibrant freshness of the ingredients reflects the care and thought put into its preparation. The perfectly cooked sunny-side-up eggs are complemented by a colorful salad bursting with flavors—crisp greens, juicy cherry tomatoes, creamy feta cheese, and briny olives. The addition of sliced avocado and deliciously seasoned pastrami adds a luxurious touch, while the toasted whole-grain bread provides a wholesome balance.
