From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The service was top-notch‚Äîour server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu.

The steak was simply outstanding. We ordered the bone-in tomahawk, and it was cooked to perfection‚Äîperfectly charred on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The seasoning was spot on, and the flavor was out of this world. We got 2 Lobster tails on the side and equally as impressive. The sides were phenomenal too. Lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and onion rings which all paired perfectly with the steak.

Our bartender Liz, made some amazing cocktails to go along with the dinner. Even the manager (Lauren) was great and made sure every aspect of our meal was perfect.

Overall, this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. If you're a steak lover this place is a must-visit! Will definitely be back soon.",1737858720,FALSE,"THE WEST SHORE INN RESTAURANT"
