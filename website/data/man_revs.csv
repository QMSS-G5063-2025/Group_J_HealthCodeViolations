The mains really lacked in flavor once we finished the appetizers.  The appetizers did not disappoint at all! The drinks were phenomenal, it will give you a buzz and tastes great!

Service: If I could give 0 stars I would. He was inattentive, I had to constantly find him when we needed something. He never checked in on how our meal was going or if we even needed anything.  The buss-boys were seen more frequently and asked us how we were more than our sever, definitely brings the experience value down by a lot.

Ambiance/Vibes: Music was GREAT! The atmosphere is very picturesque for all the content creators out there.

Will I be going back‚Ä¶. Definitely not. Do I recommend it - yes. This is a one time place to eat, I can get better service and food elsewhere for 1/2 the price, but it was fun for a midweek girls night.

Bathrooms were clean which I love.!",1738244580,FALSE,"SEI LESS"

But Sei Less delivered.

Tucked into Midtown, this modern Asian fusion spot is a gem. The energy is upscale but not pretentious ‚Äî just the kind of place that feels like a real night out without trying too hard. We arrived as a group of four around 5pm on a Wednesday, fresh from a long day of wedding dress shopping. The hostess greeted us warmly and seated us right away, and the timing was perfect ‚Äî right before the dinner rush, while the kitchen was just warming up. The space was already glowing, but still quiet enough to take a breath and enjoy it.

Our server was incredibly helpful and easygoing. He offered suggestions from both the food and cocktail menus ‚Äî and we gladly took his lead. We ordered the spicy tuna crispy rice, Shanghai spare ribs, salt and pepper shrimp, filet mignon with broccoli, chicken lo mein, Alaskan king crab fried rice, and bok choy with garlic.

Each dish arrived beautifully presented, and almost everything we tried was outstanding. The crispy rice had the perfect crunch ‚Äî warm, fresh, and topped with just the right amount of spicy tuna. The filet was a standout: incredibly tender, well-seasoned, and honestly just melted in your mouth. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to love the lo mein as much as I did, but it was delicious ‚Äî the kind of comfort dish that feels elevated and thoughtful. The bok choy was bright, garlicky, and perfectly cooked ‚Äî no bitterness, no sogginess, just clean flavor. The spare ribs had great depth, and the shrimp had that classic salt-and-pepper crisp without being overly heavy.

If I had to pick a least favorite, it would be the fried rice. It wasn‚Äôt bad by any means, just not as flavorful or memorable as the rest. That said, everything else more than made up for it.

The vibe throughout dinner was relaxed but polished ‚Äî a great mix of modern and moody. It felt like a place where you could celebrate something special or just enjoy a really good meal with friends who appreciate good taste.

The bartender and service staff deserve special mention ‚Äî kind, attentive, and confident without hovering. We never felt rushed, and it was clear that hospitality is part of the culture here.

Whether you're a former NYC regular looking for something new or just in town for a night and want something stylish but grounded ‚Äî Sei Less is absolutely worth a visit. It‚Äôs a restaurant that understands both flavor and feeling.",1745151274,FALSE,"SEI LESS"
