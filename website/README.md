## This is a folder that holds (mostly) everything to run a website through Shiny directly.

### To-Dos to get it running
1. Download income data set here & add it to the downloaded 'data' folder: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-X_PZn62QWfykZ6V-A3OYG_dwZhovDWj/view?usp=drive_link
2. Unzip the hcvyear.csv file such that it is in the data folder as such
3. Ensure the 'website' folder is on your desktop to avoid needing to recode the pathways to run the website through R & Shiny
