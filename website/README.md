## Website Directory
This directory hosts all the files necessary to run our app from your own R platform (e.g. RStudio). This is the code we used to publish our website through Shinyapp.io.

### Contents
1. app.R: Our main file for running the app (includes UI and Server)
2. __.R: Helper function files for the app
3. /data: includes all the data used in our app. It includes raw data & cleaned data that helped prevent memory overload when the website renders
