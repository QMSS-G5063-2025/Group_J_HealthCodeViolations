We‚Äôve gotten their seafood pancake and bibimbaps before too. While they‚Äôre good, for the price point the value is not there. Each of their dishes are minimum $20 and even for the broth soups they‚Äôre very minimal portions.

For two people and only two mains, a check of over ~$70 with tax/tip doesn‚Äôt seem justified. You can find plenty other good eat options in ktown that will give you better bang for your buck. And probably better service too.",1743893805,FALSE,"GAMMEEOK"

Rice dumplings, rice rolls, porridge, pork and shrimp dim sum dishes were slightly below average. The grilled fish was expensive $13 for a 9 inch grilled fish. Taste wise, its fine. Nothing to write home about.

For the curious who wants to experience a typical Hong Kong diner feel, this is probably one of the last places in Chinatown to do it.",1661797688,FALSE,"MEE SUM CAFE"
