On March 29, 2025, I removed the cheesecake from the refrigerator to serve at a birthday gathering. As I began cutting the cake, I noticed blue discoloration inside. Concerned, I flipped the cheesecake over and discovered more blue spots. Upon further inspection, I found that the bottom portion of the cheesecake was fully covered in mold, rendering it inedible.

I immediately attempted to contact the bakery to report the issue, but my calls were not answered. The following day, on March 30, 2025, I was able to reach the bakery and explained the situation. I was informed that refunds were not issued to cards and that I could only receive store credit to make another purchase.

I declined this offer, as I had become aware of similar complaints through the reviews regarding the bakery‚Äôs products.
